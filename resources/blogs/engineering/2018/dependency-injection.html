    <h1>Are you using Dependency Injection correctly</h1>

    <br/><br/>
    <h3>What is Dependency Injection?</h3>

    <p>
        Technically, Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. 
        <br/><br/>
        <i>Duh..!!!</i>
        <br/><br/>
        Yes, I understand, I also hate such definitions. Let’s talk informally from now on.
        <br/><br/>
        The concept of dependency injection says, One particular class or implementation should not be worried about the 
        change in the implementation of a nested logic. The changing logic should be kept separate from the original class 
        so that if any of the business rules or underneath logic changes, it should not require a change in the original 
        class or implementation. 
        <br/>
        In more simpler words, if some definition residing at some place changes its dependencies should not change.
        The original class or implementation should only be dependent on the final outcome or result of the dependent class 
        and not on how the outcome was implemented. 
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Dependency Injection?</h3>

    <p>
        Since now you know what Dependency Injection is and why did it pop out, We will look at how can we actually inject our 
        dependencies in code. There are three ways of doing this,
        <ul>
            <li>Property-based</li>
            A property-based DI means directly autowiring the dependency while declaring the variable. This is not-at-all testable 
            as this means you don’t have any way to actually initialise in case of unit-testing. Below is the (most evil) code,
            <div class="code">
                class Package { <br/>
                    <br/>
                    @Autowired private Device mobile; <br/>
                    @Autowired private Charger charger; <br/>
                    <br/>
                } <br/>
            </div>

            <li>Setter-based</li>
            A setter-based DI means autowiring the dependency using the setter of the variable. Below is the code,
            <div class="code">
                class Package { <br/>
                    <br/>
                    private Device mobile; <br/>
                    private Charger charger; <br/>
                    <br/>
                    @Autowired public void setDevide (Device mobile) { <br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;this.mobile = mobile; <br/>
                    } <br/>
                    <br/>
                    @Autowired public void setCharger (Charger charger) { <br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;this.charger = charger; <br/>
                    } <br/>
                    <br/>
                } <br/>
            </div>

            <li>Constructor-based</li>
            A constructor-based DI means autowiring the dependency only when the actual Object/Bean creation is done. This is more 
            intuitive and testable. Below is the code,
            <div class="code">
                class Package { <br/>
                    <br/>
                    private Device mobile; <br/>
                    private Charger charger; <br/>
                    <br/>
                    @Autowired public Package (Device mobile, Charger charger) { <br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;this.mobile = mobile; <br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;this.charger = charger; <br/>
                    } <br/>
                    <br/>
                } <br/>
            </div>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <br/><br/>
    <h3>Why prefer Constructor-based DI?</h3>

    <p>
        When you closely look at what Dependency Injection via constructors say you find it intuitive and the correct thing to do. <br/>
        Constructor-based DI says, pass all the dependencies for the given class to my constructor. This means if one does not 
        provide all the dependencies, object creation will not take place.
        <br/><br/>
        One might argue, we can always pass the dependencies as null and create the desired object. Yes, this is true, one can do 
        this but passing null for resolving a dependency cannot be counted as a mistake or unintentional.
        If someone does this, he/she will be fully aware of the consequences (one being the NullPointerException ).
        <br/><br/>
        If we consider an informal view of this, constructor-based DI says if you want to manufacture a new Handset (object), 
        the manufacturer (developer) needs to keep the Mobile set (dependency 1), a Mobile charger (dependency 2), usage handbook (dependency 3) 
        at the same time and then pack it for sale. In the case of the other two, this is not the case and the manufacturer has high 
        chances of missing something in the packing which might lead to a poor review on Flipkart or Amazon.
    </p>

    <h3>What about Spring IOC?</h3>

    <p>
        Spring framework’s Inversion of Control is nothing but handling of the dependencies in your source code.
        Spring came out with IoC and said Developers should not be concerned with service object creation but only with the business logic and rules
        associated with them. <br/>
        IoC underneath uses the principle of Dependency Injection for creation of Objects that can be used by developers without worrying about 
        managing the memory. 
        <br/><br/>
        In a very crude definition, Spring creates singleton objects of these annotated classes and keeps them in a map from where these are 
        passed on to every dependent classes to be used without consuminng any extra memory.
