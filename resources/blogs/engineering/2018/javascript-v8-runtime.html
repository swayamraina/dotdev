    <h1>Introduction to JavaSript V8 runtime</h1>

    <br/><br/>
    <p>
        Javascript has always been a pain for every backend developer. You may dislike it but sometimes we do have to write JS. This article 
        will be revolving around the Event Loop, a small but very important part of the entire V8 engine.
        <br/><br/>
        If you don’t know about V8, well it is the javascript runtime engine. V8 compiles javascript directly to native machine code 
        before executing it. The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re-optimized) dynamically at runtime, based on heuristics of 
        the code’s execution profile. <br/>
        A quick fact, V8 is used by techs like NodeJS, MongoDB, Couchbase and many more.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Let’s start a bit formally! What is JavaScript.?</b> <br/>
        Well, Javascript is a single threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent programming language.
        <br/><br/>
        <i>Duh...!!!</i>
        <br/><br/>
        Single threaded simply means, The Javascript code you write is run on a single thread. Yes, No concurrency!
        <br/><br/>
        The first thought that should pop out of every tech person is, if it is single threaded how can it be non-blocking or concurrent. <br/>
        Well, the answer is… BROWSERS!
        <br/><br/>
        Javascript itself is synchronous and blocking (and no one can change that) but the environment in which it is run can support these 
        two. Developers clearly knew to achieve these two the browsers need to be real smart. <br/>
        The browser provides various WebAPIs which a developer can leverage and let javascript behave in an asynchronous manner. I hope you 
        get it now.

    <h3>Components of javascript runtime</h3>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Call Stack</li>
            <li>Heap</li>
            <li>WebAPIs</li>
            <li>Callback Queue</li>
            <li>Event Loop</li>
            <li>Render Queue</li>
        </ul>

        We will learn about them one by one. First two are straightforward and easy to understand.
        
        <br/><br/>
        <h4>Call Stack</h4>

        <p>
            The call stack is a data structure which keeps information about the active functions (functions in execution) and prints 
            out the information when an exception is thrown. <br/>
            This is the area where the stack frames are maintained. Javascript is single threaded language, So this means it has only 
            one call stack and sadly it can do only one thing at a time.
        </p>


        <br/><br/>
        <h4>Heap</h4>

        <p>
            The heap is a portion where all the memory allocation takes place. All the objects that are created are stored in the heap 
            section of the runtime.
        </p>


        <br/><br/>
        <h4>WebAPIs</h4>

        <p>
            If we see the Chrome V8 source code, we’ll not find important javascript functions like setTimeout(), post(), get() etc. <br/>
            These functions are provided as WebAPIs by the browser to make javascript behave as asynchronous and non-blocking. Any of 
            the async work that needs to be performed is pushed to the browser to complete using one of many worker threads from the 
            thread pool. 
            <br/><br/>
            But why do we need WebAPIs?
            <br/><br/>
            As said earlier, since javascript is a single threaded language. Any type of blocking code will kill the UI/UX of the application.
            By blocking code, I mean not only AJAX requests but also functions that may take a long time to execute. Like these:

            <div class="code">
                var i=0;
                while(i&lt;1000000000) i++;

                processImage = function () { 
                &emsp;&emsp; ...
                }
            </div>
        </p>


        <br/><br/>
        <h4>Callback queue</h4>

        <p>
            To understand callback queue, we should first understand callbacks. <br/>
            A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function (let’s call this 
            other function “otherFunction”) as a parameter, and this callback function is called (or executed) inside the otherFunction. <br/>
            So, the callback queue contains all the callbacks that are requested for execution.
            <br/><br/>
            All the functions sent to the webAPI by the V8 are pushed to the callback queue with the callback function once the response from 
            the outgoing thread is received.
        </p>


        <br/><br/>
        <h4>Event Loop</h4>

        <p>
            The Event loop is part of the runtime engine whose lone job is to look at the call stack and the task queue for changes. If the 
            call stack is empty, the event loop picks up the first entry in the task queue (callback queue), if not empty, and pushes it to 
            the call stack for execution.
            <br/><br/>
            Let’s see an example code to understand this,
            
            <div class="code">
                console.log("Hi! "); 

                setTimeout(function() { 
                &emsp;&emsp;console.log("tech"); 
                },5000); 

                console.log("I &lt;3 ");
            </div>

            if we look at the code, it seems obvious setTimeout() will wait for 5 seconds and then fire off. Well, this is not the case 
            always that it will fire off after 5 seconds. <br/>
            Remember I told you JS is single threaded… Yes, it will only fire off when the thread is available to execute this code i.e 
            it will execute only when the call stack is empty.

            <div class="code">
                console.log("Hi! "); 

                setTimeout(function() { 
                &emsp;&emsp;console.log("tech"); 
                },0); 

                console.log("I &lt;3 ");
            </div>

            The 0 ms timeout does not mean this will be executed immediately. But this function will first be submitted to the V8 for execution. 
            Meanwhile the JS thread is free for execution and picks up the next execution statement. The V8 engine meantime pushes the submitted 
            function’s callback to the callback queue. Once the call stack is empty, Event loop picks the callback function and submits to the JS 
            thread for execution.
            <br/><br/>
            Similarly, all the webAPIs work the same way,

            <div class="code">
                console.log("about to do a GET request");
                $.get('https://www.google.co.in/search?q=swayam+raina', 
                &emsp;&emsp;function(data) { 
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;console.log("completed network request"); 
                &emsp;&emsp;}); 
                console.log("GET request pushed to WebAPI block");
            </div>

            This is how async is established in V8. The block of code is sent to the webAPI for an XHR request which is then pushed to task 
            queue and eventually to the call stack.
            <br/><br/>
            The onClick() function is also similar. When we click a button, the onClick function is pushed to the webAPI for execution and a 
            worker thread executes that part of the code.
        </p>


        <br/><br/>
        <h4>Render queue</h4>

        <p>
            There are continuous actions being performed by the user. So the browser has to repaint the screen to maintain smooth functioning. 
            Typically, browser repaints the screen after 16 ms i.e. at 60fps, but at the same time, it also has to execute the JS code written 
            by the developer.<br/>
            It cannot do a render if there is some code inside the call stack. Render is also treated as a callback, difference being render 
            callback is given the highest priority (Well, the browser is a bit mean.. huh!) After 16 ms, the render callback is pushed to the 
            front of render queue and the event loop now waits for the call stack to be cleared. As soon as it finds stack to be empty, it 
            pushes the render callback for execution i.e. repaint of the screen takes place.
        </p>

    </p>

    <h3>The BIG picture</h3>

    <p>
        If you closely look at the idea, This led to the birth of event driven programming or more formally Reactive programming. <br/>
        At every level, we can have a buffer queue where the threads can submit the tasks and return back to pick up new requests. 
        The next level of thread pool can pick up tasks from this buffer queue and can either process them completely (if processing 
        is contained to their system) or do some processing and then submit the task to another buffer queue where rest of the processing 
        can happen.
