    <h3>Flipkart-Ultra project</h3>

    <p>
        oone can deny the presence of e-commerce companies like Flipkart and Amazon these days and the footfall they can provide 
        to businesses. To increase the foot-fall and hence the business, Airtel decided to partner with Flipkart to allow 
        users recharge their mobile phone even through the Flipkart app. 
        <br/><br/>
        This new project required creation of a light weight React-Native version of the AirtelThanks app which was to embedded into 
        the Flipkart app. This also required heavy integrations of the Flipkart systems with the Airtel systems. <br/>
        I was presented the oppurtunity to build this new service and lead the end-to-end project from the server perspective.
        <br/><br/>
        The teams decided to use JWT for cross-service authentication and this post is about what JWT are and how they work.

    <h3>What is JWT</h3>

    <p>
        JWT or JSON Web Token is string of characters that represents some information. The information in actual is combination 
        of multiple fields separated by a ‘.’ (period). <br/>
        JWT is a combination of 3 fields:
        <ul>
            <li>header</li>
            <li>payload</li>
            <li>signature</li>
        </ul>
        in the following format:

        <div class="code">
            header.payload.signature
        </div>

        A sample JWT (used from <a href="https://jwt.io" target="_blank">here</a>), You can clearly see the 3 components.

        <div class="code">
            eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWUsImlhdC<br/>
            I6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.TCYt5XsITJX1CxPCT8yAV-TVkIEq_PbChOMqsLfRoPsnsgw5WEuts01mq-pQy7UJiN5mgRxD-WUcX16dUEMGlv50aqzpqh<br/>
            4Qktb3rk-BuQy72IFLOqV0G_zS245-kronKb78cPN25DGlcTwLtjPAYuNzVBAh4vGHSrQyHUdBBPM
        </div>

        This JWT was generated using RSA256 signature. Below is the JSONs used in generation of the token,

        <h4>header</h4>
        <div class="code">
            {<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;"alg": "RS256",<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;"typ": "JWT"<br/>
            }<br/>
        </div>

        <h4>payload</h4>
        <div class="code">
            {<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;"sub": "1234567890",<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;"name": "John Doe",<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;"admin": true,<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;"iat": 1516239022<br/>
            }<br/>
        </div>

        The header and payload are base64 encoded and passed to the selected algorithm for signature. One must understand this, We 
        only digitally sign the data and do not encrypt it (Well we do encrypt it but using only base64, which is almost like not 
        encrypting. You can decrypt any base64 message easily. <br/>
        The aim of JWT is not to hide the data in any way but to add authenticity of the data i.e. to prove that the sent data was 
        actually created by an authentic source. 
        <br/><br/>
        You can see, the header and payload can be decrypted easily using base64 decoder.
    </p>

    <h3>Symmetric signing of JWTs</h3>

    <p>
        <h4>Symmetric algorithm</h4>
        <p>
            In a Symmetric algorithm, a single key is used to encrypt the data. When encrypted with the key, the data can be decrypted 
            using the same key. If, for example, Alice encrypts a message using the key “my-secret-key” and sends it to John, he will be 
            able to decrypt the message correctly if and only if he uses the same key i.e. “my-secret-key”.
        </p>

        <h4>HMAC</h4>
        <p>
            Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs) are a group of algorithms that provide a way of signing messages by means of 
            a shared key ( “my-secret-key” should ring a bell!). In the case of HMACs, a cryptographic hash function is used 
            (for instance SHA256) and the strength of the signature depends on the hashing algorithm being used. By strength I mean, how hard 
            it is to forge an HMAC.
        </p>

        <h4>When to use HMAC based JWTs?</h4>
        <p>
            HMACs are used with JWTs when you want a simple way for all parties to create and validate JWTs. Any party knowing the key 
            can create new JWTs. In other words, with shared keys, it is possible for a person to impersonate another one. <br/>
            If you can ensure your secret key will truly be a secret and the clients you share it with are trustable, you can use HMAC based JWTs.
        </p>

        <h4>Verification process</h4>
        <p>
            User auth request lands on the auth server and after validating the credentials generates a JWT using the secret-key. 
            This JWT is passed back to the application for further API calls. Using this JWT, data requests lands the application 
            server where the server verifies the JWT using the same secret-key which was used to sign the JWT at time of creation.
        </p>
    </p>


    <br/><br/>
    <h3>Asymmetric signing of JWTs</h3>

    <p>
        <h4>Asymmetric algorithms</h4> 
        <p>
            In an Asymmetric algorithm, two keys are used to encrypt and decrypt messages. While one key(private) is used to digitally 
            sign the message and the other key(public) can only be used to verify the authenticity of the signature. So basically, John 
            can generate both public and private keys, then send only the public key to Mary to verify his messages.
        </p>

        <h4>RSA</h4>
        <p>
            RSA is an asymmetric encryption and digital signature algorithm. What asymmetric algorithms bring to the table is the 
            possibility of verifying or decrypting a message without being able to create a new one. This is key for certain use cases. <br/>
            Picture a big company where data generated by the sales team needs to be verified by the accounting team. If an HMAC were 
            to be used to sign the data, then both the sales team and the accounting team would need to know the same key (the secret-key). 
            This would allow the sales team to sign data and make it pass as if it were from the accounting team.
        </p>

        <h4>When to use RSA based JWTs?</h4>
        <p>
            JWT is particularly effective where they are used as a single-use authorization token i.e. the token is only expected to be 
            used only once. <br/>
            For example, you might run a file-hosting service where the user has to authenticate to download their files, but the 
            files themselves are served by a separate, stateless “download server”. In this case, you might want to have your application 
            server (Server A) issue single-use “download tokens”, that the client can then use to download the file from a download server 
            (Server B).
        </p>

        <h4>Verification process</h4>
        <p>
            User auth request lands on the auth server and after validating the credentials generates a JWT using the private RSA key. 
            This JWT is passed back to the application for further API calls. Using this JWT, data requests lands the application 
            server where the server verifies the JWT using the public RSA key of the auth server. If the data inside the JWT is tampered, 
            the signature verification process will fail.
        </p>
