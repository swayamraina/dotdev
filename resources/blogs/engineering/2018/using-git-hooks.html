    <h1>Why every Team should use GIT-HOOKS</h1>

    <br/><br/>
    <p>
        We all know there is a difference between writing code and writing enterprise level code. Writing an enterprise level software 
        means every developer should write not only optimized code but also a readable one.
    </p>


    <br/><br/>
    <h3>Where did it all start?</h3>

    <p>
        There is a standard to every event in the software development life-cycle. This standardisation results in better maintainability 
        of the code or project in general. <br/>
        As the team grows and developers move in and out of the team or organisation, defining processes and standards helps everyone. 
        One may not see the benefit instantly but when the rough day arrives, everyone thank to the person who thought of making processes.
        A developer in a general day writes code, a lot of code, and commits it to project repository. For a senior dev it becomes easy to 
        understand the need of a particular commit on reading a commit message. Well, I believe its hard to find such happy senior devs. <br/>
        There is a need for standardising the commit messages for a developer story. This not only makes it easier to get to know about a 
        commit but also helps keep track of the feature development.

    <h3>What are git hooks?</h3>

    <p>
        Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository. They let you customize 
        Git’s internal behavior and trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle.
        <br/><br/>
        So basically, Like any other process Git also follows a process. Every time a certain event occurs in Git lifecycle, the 
        corresponding triggers are fired. We as developers and managers can introduce standardisation to our code or to be more 
        precise software life cycle.
        <br/><br/>
        Common use cases for Git hooks include encouraging a commit policy, altering the project environment depending on the state 
        of the repository, and implementing continuous integration workflows.
        <br/><br/>
        We’ll have a closer look at two basic but very usable git-hooks.
        First let me present to you the Git-hook lifecycle.

        <h4>Local hooks</h4>
        <p>
            <div class="code">
                &lt;pre-commit&gt; <br/>
                &lt;prepare-commit-msg&gt; <br/>
                &lt;commit-msg&gt; <br/>
                &lt;post-commit&gt; <br/>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>The pre-commit script is executed every time you run git commit before Git asks the developer for a commit message 
                    or generates a commit object</li>
                <li>The prepare-commit-msg hook is called after the pre-commithook to populate the text editor with a commit message. 
                    This is where auto generated commit messages are created.</li>
                <li>The commit-msg hook is much like the prepare-commit-msg hook, but it’s called after the user enters a commit message.</li>
                <li>The post-commit hook is called immediately after the commit-msg hook. This is after a commit has taken place.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Server hooks</h4>
        <p>
            <div class="code">
                &lt;pre-receive&gt; <br/>
                &lt;update&gt; <br/>
                &lt;post-receive&gt; <br/>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>The pre-receive hook is executed every time somebody uses git push to push commits to the repository.</li>
                <li>The post-receive hook gets called after a successful push operation.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
    </p>


    <br/><br/>
    <h3>Why every Team should use hooks?</h3>

    <p>
        <h4>commit-msg</h4>
        <p>
            The only argument passed to this hook is the name of the file that contains the message. If it doesn’t like the message that 
            the user entered, it can alter this file in-place (just like with prepare-commit-msg) or it can abort the commit entirely by 
            exiting with a non-zero status.
            <br/><br/>
            This part of the cycle is an appropriate place to warn developers that their message doesn’t adhere to your team’s standards. <br/>
            By forcefully applying this restriction to commit messages, we achieve a simple yet a very challenging part of production 
            deployment. And that is “knowing exactly what might have been changed in a particular commit”
            <br/><br/>
            This is in-line with what developers see as code readability.
        </p>

        <h4>post-receive</h4>
        <p>
            The hook runs after the references are updated, so it’s a good place to enforce any kind of development policy that you want 
            like integrating Continuous Integration and a good place to perform notifications.
            <br/><br/>
            Running all the test cases, as soon as the commit has taken place helps figuring out if the incoming change resulted in any 
            type of application breakdown. If so, the fix for the same can be applied ASAP.
        </p>

        <h4></h4>
        <p>
            Git hooks can be written in any scripting language. Though I prefer python as it is easy to write and understand. <br/>
            Here is a sample commit-msg hook,

            <div class="code">
                import sys <br/>
                import re <br/>
                <br/>
                commit_regex = '\[#[0-9]+\] : [a-zA-Z ]+(\n[a-zA-Z 0-9.])+' <br/>
                <br/>
                error_message = "\ <br/>
                Aborting commit. Please ensure your commit message meets the standard requirement. \n\n \ <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;[#&lt;reference_id&gt;] : &lt;commit message&gt; \n \ <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;&lt;detailed commit message&gt; \n\n \ <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;Sample - \n \ <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;[#1234] : My first commit \n \ <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;This is my first commit to the repository\ <br/>
                " <br/>
                <br/>
                commit_msg_file_path = sys.argv[1] <br/>
            </div>
        </p>
        
    </p>
