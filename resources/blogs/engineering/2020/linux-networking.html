    Suppose you have two services, user-service (which handles authentication) and your feature-service 
    (which provides the feature to your clients). As soon as you receive the request from the user, as 
    first step you would always want to authenticate the user request.
    So here is how the end-to-end flow looks like,
    <ol>
        <li>You receive the user request with all the neccesarry data</li>
        <li>The feature-service creates the request object as per the API contract with user-srvice</li>
        <li>feature-service passes all the HTTP request data (type, url, data) to the HTTP lib being used</li>
    </ol>
    
    <ol>
        <li>the lib creates a socket to initiate the connection</li>
        <li>the lib records this socket-id and sends the (ip, port, socket-id, ...) to establish a TCP connection</li>
        <li>the user-service makes accepts this request, creates a socket at its end and makes a note of the incoming 
            socket-id (generally servers implement resource pooling and an idle socket is used) to this assigned socket</li>
        <li>the user-service returns its socket-id in the ACK response and the connection is established</li>
        <li>the lib copies the data from service buffer to the socket send buffer</li>
        <li>the kernel moves this data to one of the avaialble TX ring buffers</li>
        <li>the kernel writes the address pointer of this ring buffer into the DMA controller</li>
        <li>the DMA controller now reads this data from TX ring buffer and transmits to the NIC</li>
        <li>NIC sends this data over wire to the outer world</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li>NIC receives the data</li>
        <li>NIC writes the incoming data to the RX ring buffer using the DMA controller and raises an interrupt to the CPU</li>
        <li>the kernel copies this data from the ring buffer to the linked socket receive buffer</li>
        <li>the kernel then moves this data from the socket receive buffer to the service buffer</li>
        <li>the user-service has a pool of threads (and linked sockets) waiting for data from the connection and kernel passes the control to it</li>
        <li>the user-service reads this data from the service buffer and completes the data receiving part</li>
        <li>user-service can now query the db/cache to authenticate the request</li>
    </ol>
