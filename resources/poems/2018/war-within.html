    <h1>A war within</h1>

    <p class="poem">
        He’s fighting a war, a war within <br/>
        Defending a castle that never belonged to him <br/>
        The folk look happy unaware of the winds, <br/>
        The darkness, though, calmly rages within. <br/>
        <br/><br/>
        The queen is gone and so are the knights <br/>
        Leaving him alone to cry in these fights <br/>
        Its not his army nor his throne <br/>
        He has to fight this enemy all alone. <br/>
        <br/><br/>
        All is not sweet, All is not sound, <br/>
        Weeps the king, for someone to know. <br/>
        Still, he fights <br/>
        And brings back the light. <br/>
        <br/><br/>
        Smiles the darkness and laughs at him, <br/>
        He was the one, who had let him win. <br/>
        <br/><br/>
        Seeing the shadow rise, <br/>
        From deep down within, <br/>
        the king only said… <br/>
        I am tired of fighting this war, this war within <br/>
        trying to defend the castle, the lost castle within… <br/>
    </p>
